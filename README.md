# fsf_2019_screening_task2
Project for FOSSEE internship
<br>
<br>
Learned PyQt5 from scrath through youtube videos and OOPS concept of Python for the Develpment of this application.
<br>
Words such as "self.", "super().&lowbar;&lowbar;init__()", "&lowbar;&lowbar;intit__()", etc. were totally alienn to me.
<br>
<br>
First I made simple notepad using youtube videos and the learned some OOPS concepts, then I made a CSV file loader prior to starting this project, then after I was done with it, I started developing this application, it took me almost two weeks to learn everything and make this project, I learned a lot from this project.
<br>
<br>
Made the desktop Application which was specified in the FOSSEE Screening Task - 2, with all the necessary features such as Loading the .csv file and performing operations like Display Data, Edit Data, Add new data and plotting of graph for different columns of the file.
This software application can be used for performing operations on a file and also for plotting the data of the file, with changes here and there the editor can be also made compatible for other file extensions like .xls using their respective modules which are available as a library in Python.
